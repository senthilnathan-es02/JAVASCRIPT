// 4. If the initialDiscount is 5% and the dailyIncrease is 2%, the 
// function should calculate the total discount over 10 days.

// Day 1: 5%
// Day 2: 7% (5% + 2%)
// Day 3: 9% (7% + 2%)
// ...
// Day 10: Calculate this using a loop.
// Remember, you don't have to store each day's discount.
//  Just keep a running total of the discount percentage.
//  The challenge is to use a single loop to accumulate the total 
// discount percentage over the 10 days.
