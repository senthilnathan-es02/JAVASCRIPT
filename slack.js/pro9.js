// 9. Create a Sentence with a Time and Place
// You have two variables: time and place.
//  Concatenate them into a sentence like: "The meeting is at [time] in [place]."
//  For example, if time = "3 PM" and place = "the conference room",
//  the result should be: "The meeting is at 3 PM in the conference room.".

let time=" 3 pm ";
let place = " the conference room";
function result(){
    let answer=" The meeting is at "+time+" in the "+place;
    console.log(answer);
}
 result()
