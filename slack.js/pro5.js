// 5. Create a Simple Introduction
// Write a program that takes two variables,
//  name and age, and forms a sentence that introduces the person.
//  For example, if name = "Emma" and age = 25, the program should print: 
// "Hi, my name is Emma and I am 25 years old.".

let nam="EMMA";
let age="25";
function print(){
    let answer=" Hi, my name is "+nam+" and I am "+age+" years old";
    console.log(answer);
}
print();
