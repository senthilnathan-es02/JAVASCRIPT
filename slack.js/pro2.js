// 2. Create a Full Sentence from Variables
// You have three
//  variables: subject, verb, and object.
//  Concatenate them to form a complete sentence. 
// For example, if subject = "The cat", verb = "chased", and object = "the mouse",
//  the output should be: "The cat chased the mouse.".


let subject="The cat ";
let verb=" chased ";
let object=" the mouse";
let answer=subject+verb+object;
console.log(answer);
