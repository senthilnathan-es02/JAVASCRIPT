// 4. Combine Two Sentences
// You have two strings stored in variables.
//  Concatenate them into a single string.
//  For example, if str1 = "JavaScript is fun" and str2 = "and very useful.",
//  concatenate them to produce: "JavaScript is fun and very useful.".


let str1="Javascript is fun";
let str2=" and very useful.";
function sentence(){
    let answer = str1+str2;
    console.log(answer);
}
sentence();
