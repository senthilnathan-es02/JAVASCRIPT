//1.Sum of Numbers Until a Condition Write a program that keeps asking 
//the user for a number and adds it to a sum until the user enters a
// number greater than 100. 
//Use a while loop to keep track of the input and sum.







// Guess the Number Game Write a program where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 10,
// and the user has to guess the number. 
//The program should keep asking for guesses until the correct number is guessed.
// Use a while loop for repeated guesses.






// Calculate the Power of a Number Write a program that takes two inputs, a base b and an exponent e, and calculates b^e (b raised to the power of e) using a for loop. For example, if b = 2 and e = 3, the result should be 8.

// Count Digits in a Number Write a program that takes a number n and uses a for loop to count the number of digits in the number. For example, if n = 12345, the output should be 5.

// Print a Pattern of Stars Write a program that uses a for loop to print a triangle of stars. For example, for 5 rows, the output should be:



// While Loop:
// Print a Number's Digits in Reverse Write a program that takes a number as input and prints its digits in reverse order using a while loop. For example, if the input is 1234, the output should be 4321.
// Check if a Number is a Palindrome Write a program that takes a number as input and checks if it is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forward and backward). Use a while loop for this task. For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.
// Sum of Odd Numbers Write a program that uses a while loop to calculate the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 20.
// Find the First Factor of a Number Write a program that takes a number as input and finds its first factor (other than 1) using a while loop. For example, if the input is 15, the first factor is 3.
// Repeatedly Ask for Input Until Condition is Met Write a program that keeps asking the user for input until they enter a number greater than 50. Use a while loop to check the condition.
